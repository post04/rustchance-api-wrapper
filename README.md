# Explanation

This package is an API wrapper for the popular rust skin gambling website [rustchance](https://rustchance.com). I made this package because I wanted to play around with automatically doing things on rustchance but didn't see **ANY** public API documentation or **ANY** talk about one.

# TODO

- [ ] Search for more authorization required socket data
- [ ] Search for more authorization required http/s endpoints
- [ ] Add all /api/account/history/ API urls to the wrapper

# Note

The rustchance API is not at all documented or even meant for this type of use (non web), with that being said, rustchance has some obscure variable names that I had to go through and figure out myself. With that this wrapper is subject to human error and if you find any problems in the wrapper or in my understanding of the API please open a github issue or make a pull request!

P.S. This is what the owner of rustchance said when he saw this project, if you need a code of conduct to stay abiding by rustchance TOS just read this. ![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/61803796/115126249-a613e100-9f9b-11eb-950c-0ee0afc9a90d.png)
